	 * 
	 * packet header ------------- 31 sequence 1 does this message contains a
	 * reliable payload 31 acknowledge sequence 1 acknowledge receipt of
	 * even/odd message 16 qport
	 * 
	 * The remote connection never knows if it missed a reliable message, the
	 * local side detects that it has been dropped by seeing a sequence
	 * acknowledge higher thatn the last reliable sequence, but without the
	 * correct evon/odd bit for the reliable set.
	 * 
	 * If the sender notices that a reliable message has been dropped, it will
	 * be retransmitted. It will not be retransmitted again until a message
	 * after the retransmit has been acknowledged and the reliable still failed
	 * to get there.
	 * 
	 * if the sequence number is -1, the packet should be handled without a
	 * netcon
	 * 
	 * The reliable message can be added to at any time by doing MSG_Write*
	 * (&netchan.message, <data>).
	 * 
	 * If the message buffer is overflowed, either by a single message, or by
	 * multiple frames worth piling up while the last reliable transmit goes
	 * unacknowledged, the netchan signals a fatal error.
	 * 
	 * Reliable messages are always placed first in a packet, then the
	 * unreliable message is included if there is sufficient room.
	 * 
	 * To the receiver, there is no distinction between the reliable and
	 * unreliable parts of the message, they are just processed out as a single
	 * larger message.
	 * 
	 * Illogical packet sequence numbers cause the packet to be dropped, but do
	 * not kill the connection. This, combined with the tight window of valid
	 * reliable acknowledgement numbers provides protection against malicious
	 * address spoofing.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * The qport field is a workaround for bad address translating routers that
	 * sometimes remap the client's source port on a packet during gameplay.
	 * 
	 * If the base part of the net address matches and the qport matches, then
	 * the channel matches even if the IP port differs. The IP port should be
	 * updated to the new value before sending out any replies.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * If there is no information that needs to be transfered on a given frame,
	 * such as during the connection stage while waiting for the client to load,
	 * then a packet only needs to be delivered if there is something in the
	 * unacknowledged reliable
